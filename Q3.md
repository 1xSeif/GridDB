# Title
Performance Degradation GridDB E-Commerce System

# Problem
I was developing a GridDB-based e-commerce system and I found out that query performance has significantly degraded as the number of users and transactions has grown. 

# What did you try and what were you expecting?
I implemented the search feature with filters by category, price range, and rating. The query performance was supposed to be good, but it became very bad as the data grew. Now, the search queries take a very long time to execute, especially under high loads. 

Here is what I was trying in my code
```
import griddb_python as griddb
import time

try:
    factory = griddb.StoreFactory.get_instance()
    gridstore = factory.get_store(
        notification_member="127.0.0.1:10001",
        cluster_name="myCluster",
        username="admin",
        password="admin"
    )
    
    containerInfo = griddb.ContainerInfo("products",
                                          [["productId", griddb.Type.INTEGER],
                                           ["name", griddb.Type.STRING],
                                           ["category", griddb.Type.STRING],
                                           ["price", griddb.Type.DOUBLE],
                                           ["rating", griddb.Type.DOUBLE]],
                                          griddb.ContainerType.COLLECTION, True)
    
    container = gridstore.put_container(containerInfo)
    
    for i in range(1, 100001):
        product = (i, f"Product {i}", "Category A" if i % 2 == 0 else "Category B", 100.0 + (i % 100), 4.0)
        container.put(product)
    
    print("All products data are inserted successfully.")
    
    startTime = time.time()
    
    query = container.query("SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Category A' AND price BETWEEN 150 AND 200 AND rating >= 4.0")
    rs = query.fetch(False)
    
    results = []
    while rs.has_next():
        results.append(rs.next())
    
    endTime = time.time()
    
    print(f"Query executed in {endTime - startTime} seconds")
    print(f"Number of results: {len(results)}")
    
except griddb.GSException as e:
    for i in range(e.get_error_stack_size()):
        print("[", i, "]")
        print(e.get_error_code(i))
        print(e.get_location(i))
        print(e.get_message(i))
```
